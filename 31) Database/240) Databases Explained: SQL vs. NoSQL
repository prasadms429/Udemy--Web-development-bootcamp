// While doing API requests, we observed that data was not stored after refreshing nodemon.
// It is due to data was not stored in database.

// In magnetic based memory storage, we  have strips of electromagnets with North and south poles. By changing current we can flip North and south poles. 
// If we have two magnets of opposite direction then it would be one.  If we have two magnets of same direction then it is counted as zero.

// Types of data bases - SQL DB and NoSQL DB
// SQL DB (Structured query language) -
// It helps to query the database which structured format.
// In SQL data is stored structurally in tables.
// Our website may need to hold some data of Users. So, we need to anticipate what all other data/field our table need to store.
// Then we can create table and store records in it.

// SQL has ability to form realtionship. So, it is also called as Realtional database.
// Using Relational database we can link column of one table with another column of different table.
// By this method it will elemenate stroing many field values in single table.
// There are different types of SQL databases - Oracle, Microsoft SQL server these are paid databases.
// Opensource/ Free databases - MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite.

// NoSQL -
// In NoSQL we can change structure of data without changing structure of entire database.
// NoSQL data is stored like json format.
// We can add new field to data object without altering structure original database.
// NoSQL is flexible compared to SQL. We can add new field whenever it required and It can be scalable horizontally (To add new fields), Vertically (To add new records).
// NoSQL databases are Dynamo DB, Redis, Mongo db.
// Dynamo db is run by Amazon.
// Redis is opensource. Mongo DB and Dynamo db is run by companies, which are paid resources.
.

// SQL is structured, consistent and which is useful to maitain coding standrads. SQL will form Realtionships which is helpful for querying and interlinking many tables.
