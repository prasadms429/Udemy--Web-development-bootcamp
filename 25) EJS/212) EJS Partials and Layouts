// We can include styles to Server side code. 
// In backend like node.js, we use static files. Static files includes images and styles, which will not change in period of time.
// We have all the images and styles under "public" folder.
app.use(express.static("public"));
// In this section we included styles in index.ejs file.
// Inside public folder, styles folder is there. Inside styles folder layout.css is there.
href = "styles/layout.css"
// When we navigate to different pages on website, then it makes get request to dynamic routes (ex:- localhost:3000/contact). But the styles and images inside that website are static.
// There are many codes like styles and footer, which is repetative in each web page and to reduce repetative code, we use concept called Templating.

// To include dynamic data inside the static ejs file, we use ejs tags.

// To include repetative header and footer in all Pages
