// We have to follow some Naming convention, and we should try to give matching name for data. The name should explain, what data it contains.
//These are some valid variable name :
var myName = "Prasad";    
var yourName = "Kaju";
var myvar = "abc";
var my123 = 123;          // we can't use varibale name "123".
var myname = "Angela";    // "my name" this not valid variable name, because we can't give space in between of variable name. If we give then it treats first word as Variable name and for another word it give error, because it doesn't know what it is.
var my_name = "Angela";   // we can't use varibale name "my-name"
var userScoreFinal = 12;  // This is Camel case variable name.
