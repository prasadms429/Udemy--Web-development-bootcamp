// Create table
CREATE TABLE products (
  id INT NOT NULL, // NOT NULL will make sure if id is not provided then records will not be added to table.

  price MONEY, // To include monetory values with comma and decimal point we include data type MONEY.
  PRIMARY KEY (id) // PRIMARY KEY allows particluar column to uniquely identify each record in database. Means there should not be any duplicate id.
