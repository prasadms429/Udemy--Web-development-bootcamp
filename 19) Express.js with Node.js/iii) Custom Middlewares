// In last session, we used Pre-processing middle-ware that is Body-parser.
// In this lesson, we will be using Middleware to log our request, that is Morgan.

// This is the path to Morgan doc
https://www.npmjs.com/package/morgan

// There are many Pre defined format, that we can find in above path, the Pre defiend format tells how detail our logging should be.

// In index2.js
import express from "express";
import morgan from "morgan";     // import Morgan

const app = express();
const port = 3000;

app.use(morgan("dev"));         // Use morgan as middleware with app.use() method.
                                // Another Pre defined format called "combined" which logs, date, status code, url link etc to console.

app.get("/", (req, res) => {
  res.send("Hello");
});

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Listening on port ${port}`);
});

// In hyper
npm install morgan
nodemon index2.js

// In postman
http://localhost:3000/    // select GET method and send this
Then In hyper we get this, GET / 200 31.697 ms - 5

http://localhost:3000/submit   // select POST method and send
Then In heyper we get thsi, POST /submit 404 28.935 ms - 146
// There is no route handler called submit for this. But we are accesing it in middle, before sending to route. So, we are logging our request to console.
// We are getting status code as 404, because there is no route called submit defined.
