// An Application Programming Interface (API) is a set of commands, functions, protocols and objects that programmers can use to create software or interact with an external system.

// In some websites we can see the live weather forecast, according specific location. That weather data is taken from some other website, using their(weather website) APIs.

// Tinder matches people based upon their interest, this is done using data from facebook APIs. Facebook collects data when user logins or signup, this is accesed by tinder using APIs.

// APIs allows only to access specific data. Programers should not modify the functions or objects of data provider. ( There is a mutual agreement )
// For example, In a resturant we have menu, we can order that only and we cannot take ingreindients that is used in kitchen to make that.
// In a same way we can access temperature, weather condition, weather image and atomospheric pressure from weather app.

// jquery is an API, where we use functions, objects and methods of that to build software.

// From my server, I request for data to some others server using API. The others server send response to my server using API.
