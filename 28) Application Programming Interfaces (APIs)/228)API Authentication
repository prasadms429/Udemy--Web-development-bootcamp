There are diffenet kind of API authentication -
1. No Authentication
2. Basic Authentication
3. API key authorization
4. Token based Authentication

To restrict all user from using API we have some Authentication to API.

No Authentication -
Previosuly for Bored API we didn't have any authentication. Anyone can access it.
But for Bored API we have rate limit. Which is having 100 request per minute.

Basic Authentication -
Basic Authentication will have USER name and Password for Authentication.
Usually in base authentication, we pass over base 64 endcode string in header of request.
Base 64 will take ASCCI character(Text) and convert that to bits (0's and 1's) and encode it another character.
