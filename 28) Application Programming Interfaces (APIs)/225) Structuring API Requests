// In this lesson, we will learn Formatting our API requests.
// We may have our own Frontend and Backend. Our forntend send request to backend using HTTP GET request and we get Response from our Server by using Private API.
// Anyone else such as Frontend of others may not be able to access our server thorugh our Private API because, they don't know the what is the structure our server and
// format to request to our server. If somebody knows how our server is structured then they are able to tap into our server.

// If our sever is able to interact with someone else server through GET request and get Response using Public API. Then, Probably they have documented how to use Public API or
// they have exposed certain parts of there server, so anyody can use it (Someone else server). 
// We learn how to use Public API's.

// This is the API documentaion url for things to do in boring time.
https://bored-api.appbrewery.com/
// API end points - Structuring our request
// After url we specify the endpoints like this "https://bored-api.appbrewery.com/endpint" . 
// It will tell where to route our request. Because, inside url there are many endpoints(Each endpoints perform differnt job).
// To get random activity make request to this endpoint, which is specified in documentation.
https://bored-api.appbrewery.com/random    // Make a GET request in Postman.

// To provide additional information to API we use parameters.
// We define parameter in query value pair. First Parameter is given after '?' in url. Subsequent parameters are differentiated using '&'.
// Example - https://bored-api.appbrewery.com/filter?type=social&participants=2        // This will filter our API result by activity type and number of participants
// We use parameters in API for filtering, Searching and many more.


// Path Parameters
structure -
bored-api.appbrewery.com/endpoint/{path-parameter}

// Path parameters is used access the Resources of id, Username.
// We hit endpoint route using GET request.
// Endpoint is constant. Doesn't vary.
// path-parameter can vary.
// Query parameters are used to filtering, Searching.
// Example of path parameter -
https://bored-api.appbrewery.com/activity/5914292      // By using this id at end will give specific activity of movie marathon.
