// JSON - Javascript Object Notation
// JSON is similar to Javascript object. Javascript objects contains key value pair separated by colon. JSON also contains key, value pair and contains key within "".
// All key in Json are considered as String.
// JSON is used to transfer data over internet in a readable format.

// When we want to transfer wardrobe from shop to home, we will flatten it by arraing all of its material. So, space is minimized and easy to carry, 
// without carrying air inside it and all.
// In a same way JSON is flattened over internet in a serial format. Then it will become easy to transfer. After Json reaches the destination then it will be arranged
// to it's original format.

// In this website we can view the serial Json on internet in a Formatted view -
