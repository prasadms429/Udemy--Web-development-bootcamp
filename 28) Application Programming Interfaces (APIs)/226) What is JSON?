// JSON - Javascript Object Notation
// JSON is similar to Javascript object. Javascript objects contains key value pair separated by colon. JSON also contains key, value pair and contains key within "".
// All key in Json are considered as String.
// JSON is used to transfer data over internet in a readable format.

// When we want to transfer wardrobe from shop to home, we will flatten it by arraing all of its material. So, space is minimized and easy to carry, 
// without carrying air inside it and all.
// In a same way JSON is flattened over internet in a serial format. Then it will become easy to transfer. After Json reaches the destination then it will be arranged
// to it's original format.

// In this website we can view the serial Json on internet in a Formatted view -
https://jsonviewer.stack.hu/
// Paste the serial Json on Text window, then click on Viewer tab.

// To convert javascript object to JSON (With serial format and key will be in "")
// JS Object -> JSON
const jsonData = JSON.stringify(data);

// To convert JSON to Javascirpt object format. Serial format to Java script object format. By removing "" in key.
// JSON -> JS Object
cosnt data = JSON.parse(jsonData);
