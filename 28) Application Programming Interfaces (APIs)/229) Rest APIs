With axios we can use axios.get().then() functionality or 
async await axios.get() 
both types will do same work.
Once after code inside await is executed, other code will be executed line by line.
async await modern Javascript syntax.

HTTP protocol -
GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE

While doing fetch request we are passing,
axios.get("URL", config)
Now for Post request we will pass,
axios.post("URL", body, config)
In body we will pass html body data such as User name and password.

In config we can pass basic authentication values, parameters, headers required for bearer token authorization.
If we want to replace some data from backend with new data then we make Put request. 
axios.put("URL", body, config)
syntax of put request is similar to post request.

If we want to update some data then we make Patch request.
axios.patch("URL", body, config)

Delete syntax -
axios.delete("URL", config)

We will use config to pass Javascript object.
axios.post("URL[, data[, config]])
If mention parameters inside sqare bracket then it is opetional to use. Here data and config are optional to pass.
