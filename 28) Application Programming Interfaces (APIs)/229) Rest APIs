With axios we can use axios.get().then() functionality or 
async await axios.get() 
both types will do same work.
Once after code inside await is executed, other code will be executed line by line.
async await modern Javascript syntax.

HTTP protocol -
GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE

While doing fet request we are passing,
axios.get("URL", config)
Now for Post request we will pass,
axiox.post("URL", body, config)
In body we will pass html body data such as User name and password.
