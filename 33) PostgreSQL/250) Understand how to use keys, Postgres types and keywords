// Columns in table is known an fields.
// We can store data in excel. But if we store many records/ data in it then excel will take more time to open or load all data present inside it.
// Database is faster than excel and it will form realtionships between tables. In database we can define table with certain conditions.
// In postgres there is more datatypes avialable compared to SQL.

// To create table using postgres
Create table friends (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,  // Primary key ensures any of the entry going into the id field must be unique and it uniquely identifies each record in table.
  name VARCHAR(50),
  age INT,
  is_cool BOOLEAN
);

// Postgres keyword SERIAL means if add new record to friends table then no need to specify the id. SERIAL will auto increment id value based previous record id value.

// VARCHAR can have maximum character value upto 50 characters in frieds table. 
// If name field is having 3 characters then it will take only 3 bytes. The size of field is auto adjusted based on number of characters.

// There is another data type called TEXT. Which is little slow compared VARCHAR. In VARCHAR always we need to specify the maximum number of characters.
// But in TEXT datatype, no need to specify maximum number of characters. Size will be adjusted based on NAME field value.

// BOOLEAN is binary option to store True or False values.

// For more details of Postgresql data types -
https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/datatype.html

// serial8 data type will store eight digit value. If we want store billion or more records with auto increment then we use bigserial.
// varchar will store variable length character string.
// date to store date
